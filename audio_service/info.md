Create transcription
post
 
https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/transcriptions
Transcribes audio into the input language.

Request body
file
file

Required
The audio file object (not file name) to transcribe, in one of these formats: flac, mp3, mp4, mpeg, mpga, m4a, ogg, wav, or webm.

model
string

Required
ID of the model to use. The options are gpt-4o-transcribe, gpt-4o-mini-transcribe, and whisper-1 (which is powered by our open source Whisper V2 model).

chunking_strategy
"auto" or object

Optional
Controls how the audio is cut into chunks. When set to "auto", the server first normalizes loudness and then uses voice activity detection (VAD) to choose boundaries. server_vad object can be provided to tweak VAD detection parameters manually. If unset, the audio is transcribed as a single block.


Show possible types
include[]
array

Optional
Additional information to include in the transcription response. logprobs will return the log probabilities of the tokens in the response to understand the model's confidence in the transcription. logprobs only works with response_format set to json and only with the models gpt-4o-transcribe and gpt-4o-mini-transcribe.

language
string

Optional
The language of the input audio. Supplying the input language in ISO-639-1 (e.g. en) format will improve accuracy and latency.

prompt
string

Optional
An optional text to guide the model's style or continue a previous audio segment. The prompt should match the audio language.

response_format
string

Optional
Defaults to json
The format of the output, in one of these options: json, text, srt, verbose_json, or vtt. For gpt-4o-transcribe and gpt-4o-mini-transcribe, the only supported format is json.

stream
boolean or null

Optional
Defaults to false
If set to true, the model response data will be streamed to the client as it is generated using server-sent events. See the Streaming section of the Speech-to-Text guide for more information.

Note: Streaming is not supported for the whisper-1 model and will be ignored.

temperature
number

Optional
Defaults to 0
The sampling temperature, between 0 and 1. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. If set to 0, the model will use log probability to automatically increase the temperature until certain thresholds are hit.

timestamp_granularities[]
array

Optional
Defaults to segment
The timestamp granularities to populate for this transcription. response_format must be set verbose_json to use timestamp granularities. Either or both of these options are supported: word, or segment. Note: There is no additional latency for segment timestamps, but generating word timestamps incurs additional latency.

Returns
The transcription object, a verbose transcription object or a stream of transcript events.
